* Final project for UNH-Manchester course COMP705 (Full-Stack Development)

<h3>
What's this thing gonna do?
</h3>
The idea is for this to be a simple and friendly way for Spotify users to use our website to obtain some data about their usage of the platform, such as time listened to songs in their libraries, favorite artists or songs, total time music has played over various time frames, etc.. 

The website will not allow users to access content on Spotify rather, just data about content.

Users will authenticate to Spotify via API connections that our webapp will make. Our webapp will not store any personal information of users, such as their passwords to access their Spotify accounts.

<h3>
How's it gonna work?
</h3>
Spotify nicely provides a robust developer presence, including public access to its REST API! 

We will be doing much research from the materials found on their developer.spotify.com website. (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

Authentication adheres to the OAuth 2.0 standard (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
