<h3>Desired features:</h3>

* As a Spotify user, I am interested in gathering statistics about my listening habits or about my library. I wish to see:
  * A list of all the songs in my 'Liked Songs' playlist, to include the count of all items.
  * Which song and/or artist have I listened to the most.
  * Which playlist do I listen to the most
  * Which genres I listen to the most
  * How many hours I have used the platform over differing time intervals (user selectable), such as the last 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or a year.
  * Any other useful data we may be able to collect from Spotify.

* I wish to be able to select multiple types of available data to build out a report of the data. I should be able to select any amount of data from one type, to all available types, for creating the report.

* This output should appear in a clearly readable report or box on the webpage, but we also need some export options.
  * I would like to export this as a CSV (at the bare minimum) or Excel spreadsheet (XSLX) (desired) or to email the data to myself (most desired).
