This program will process a list of integers that are randomly generated and tell the user the maximum value in the set.

A second test will verify that the array module can handle if an empty set is passed into it.

The find_max method in my_array.py will process the array that is generated from tests.py main function, and return a variable called result

*ISSUES ENCOUNTERED*:
Naming the module array.py as the instructions dictated and importing it would import a built-in module rather than the module I made. I made the decision to counter the instructions and name this module my_array.py instead, and was able to import successfully after this. Worked one-on-one with Professor Sabin to troubleshoot this issue.
